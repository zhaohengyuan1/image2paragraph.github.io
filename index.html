        <h2 class="Motivation"> Motivation</h2>
        <h4 class="subtitle">
          How to represent images as high-quality text has always been a popular problem. The traditional idea of Image Caption and Dense Caption such as Show, and Tell relies on a lot of manual annotation. The first relies on annotation platforms such as Amazon AMT to write a description for each image. A series of rules are added, such as number of nouns, color, etc. Usually a short sentence is used to describe a diagram.

However, this plain markup idea creates a serious One-to-many problem. For example, a picture corresponds to a lot of text. Due to the asymmetry of information between pictures and texts, the results of training on such data can easily fall into mediocre solutions. (A problem often encountered in Pretrain as well)

LLM (Large Language Model), especially ChatGPT, has shown an unparalleled logical ability. We were surprised to find that by giving Bounding Box and Object information to GPT4, GPT4 could naturally reason about the location of objects and even imagine the connections between them.

          ["LLaVA", "When visiting this peaceful location with a pier extending over a serene lake, surrounded by mountains, there are several things to be cautious about. First, pay attention to the weather conditions, as sudden changes in weather, especially strong winds or storms, can cause the water to become rough and pose risks to the stability of the pier. Second, be mindful of the structural integrity of the pier; avoid overloading it with too many people or excessive weight, as this could potentially damage the pier or cause it to collapse. Additionally, be aware of the surrounding wildlife and respect their space; do not harm or disturb them in any way. Finally, if you decide to go fishing, ensure that you adhere to any local fishing regulations and use appropriate fishing techniques to keep the lake ecosystem healthy and maintain the balance of the food chain.â€‹â€‹"],

The pier extending over the calm water provided an excellent vantage point from which to appreciate the breathtaking scenery. As I stood on the pier, I couldn't help but feel a deep connection with nature, taking a moment to soak in the peaceful atmosphere.â€‹

One of the highlights of my trip was undoubtedly the fishing experience. The area is teeming with life, and I was thrilled to land a sizeable catch, despite the modest size of the lake. The joy of fishing in such a beautiful setting was truly rewarding, and it allowed me to take a break from my busy life and truly immerse myself in the tranquility of nature.â€‹

While exploring the surrounding area, I came across a family of birds that had built a nest close to the pier, adding to the charm of the location. Interacting with the wildlife and observing their behavior was an enriching experience that I'll cherish for years to come.â€‹

In conclusion, this idyllic destination provided me with an opportunity to unwind and recharge, surrounded by mesmerizing natural beauty and the gentle sounds of water and wildlife.
